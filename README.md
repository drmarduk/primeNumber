# Prime number

*This small go program output the wanted prime number*

The argument added at the call of the program should be the wanted prime number. Like the hundredth is 541.

## Example

```
./primeNumber 1000
Getting the primary number at position of 1000
Got it in 5.962807ms : 7919
```

## Why ?

This code was written in two small train travel just for fun. So mistakes could be present !
